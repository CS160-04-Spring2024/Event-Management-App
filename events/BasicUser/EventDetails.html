                        Polnareff, for what purpose do humans live? They live to attain peace of mind 
                        by conquering their fears and anxieties. Seeking fame, controlling others, and 
                        acquiring wealth are methods by which they attain peace of mind. Some even chose 
                        to attain peace of mind through friendships or marriage. When humans express 
                        willingness to help others, or proclaim their actions to be in the name of love 
                        or peace, their true motive is really to attain peace of mind. Attaining peace of 
                        mind is the true goal of all mankind. So tell me, now that I have enlightened you, 
                        why do you still feel anxiety in serving me? This is the simplest path to 
                        attaining peace of mind. Doesn't the thought of challenging me, knowing it may 
                        bring about your demise, give you anxiety?

                        My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the 
                        northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am 
                        not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department 
                        stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t 
                        smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make 
                        sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a 
                        glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches 
                        before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until 
                        morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or 
                        stress in the morning.
